[2018-06-11] Challenge #363 [Easy] I before E except after C
Background
"I before E except after C" is perhaps the most famous English spelling rule. For the purpose of this challenge, the rule says:

if "ei" appears in a word, it must immediately follow "c".

If "ie" appears in a word, it must not immediately follow "c".

A word also follows the rule if neither "ei" nor "ie" appears anywhere in the word.
